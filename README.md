# covid-19
Repository to keep the prediction results to Covid-19's spreading in Brazil.

It comprises data from World Health Organization (WHO) and was organized by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). From March, 18th to June, 7th I updated the data based on information provided by the [brazilian Ministry of Health](https://plataforma.saude.gov.br/novocoronavirus). Since June, 8th my source is the media consortium (O Estado de S. Paulo, Extra, Folha, O Globo, G1 and UOL). 

Updates can be read at my [personal blog](https://tibau.org/2020/03/16/covid-19-predictions-to-brazil/) or at a [LikedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/covid-19-predictions-brazil-marcelo-tibau).

After July 31 I discontinued the forecast model. I will keep though a daily update of the number of cases and deaths at the GitHub repo.
