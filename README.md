# covid-19
Repository to keep tabs on the Covid-19 spreading in Brazil.

It comprises data from World Health Organization (WHO) and was organized by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). From March 18th to June 7th, 2020 I updated the data based on information provided by the [brazilian Ministry of Health](https://plataforma.saude.gov.br/novocoronavirus). From June 8th, 2020 to January 28th, 2023 my source was the media consortium (O Estado de S. Paulo, Extra, Folha, O Globo, G1 and UOL).

The dataset was consolidated on January 30th, 2023 based on the last update from the media consortium that disbanded on January 28th, 2023.

The dataset comprises 1067 lines of data regarding total cases and total deaths, consolidated per day.

After July 31, 2020 I discontinued the forecast model that I initially used. The old reports can be read at my [personal blog](https://tibau.org/2020/03/16/covid-19-predictions-to-brazil/) or at a [LikedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/covid-19-predictions-brazil-marcelo-tibau).
